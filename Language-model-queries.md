## Q: Give a short introduction to the optimization process gentic algorithms. Explain each operator and the optimization loop in one sentence.  

### A: 
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimization methods inspired by natural evolution, where a population of solutions evolves toward better performance through selection, crossover, and mutation in iterative loops.

- **Selection**: Chooses the best-performing individuals (solutions) based on fitness to propagate their traits to the next generation.  
- **Crossover (Recombination)**: Combines pairs of selected individuals to produce new offspring by mixing their features.  
- **Mutation**: Introduces random changes in offspring to maintain diversity and explore new solutions.  
- **Optimization Loop**: Repeats the process of selection, crossover, and mutation over multiple generations until a stopping criterion, such as convergence or a maximum iteration count, is met.
